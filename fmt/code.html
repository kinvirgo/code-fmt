            In code styleguides, maximum line length rules are often set to 100
            or 120. However, when humans write code, they donâ€™t strive to reach
            the maximum number of columns on every line. Developers often use
            whitespace to break up long lines for readability. In practice, the
            average line length often ends up well below the maximum.
